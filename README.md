This project delves into the intricacies of film revenue generation, seeking to unravel the relationships between budget allocations, critical scores, thematic elements, and their collective impact on box office success. Utilizing advanced statistical models, including Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Random Forest, this analysis not only uncovers the quantitative metrics influencing revenue but also explores qualitative aspects through text mining and geospatial visualization.

Objectives
To identify key predictors of film revenue and their impact.
To assess the role of thematic elements in movie overviews on revenue generation.
To provide actionable insights for filmmakers and distributors on optimizing financial returns.
